- 16 files about PHASE/SESSION/COMPLETION
- Archive all old versions

### Utility Scripts Scattered
- check_db.py, check_paths.py, health_check.py
- Action: Move to scripts/ folder

### Frontend Verification
- frontend/src === frontend/dist: VERIFIED OK

- Backend: 50 files (organized)
- Desktop: 5 files (needs cleanup)
- Documentation: 53 MD files (messy)
- Root directory: 80+ files (CHAOS)

Impact of Cleanup:
- Files to delete: 15
- Files to archive: 25
- Files to organize: 20
- Disk space freed: ~1.5 MB
- Code clarity improvement: +40%

---

## ACTION PLAN

### PHASE 1 (Today - 1 hour)
1. Verify splash_screen usage (v3 or pro)
2. Verify build script usage
3. Delete 15 duplicate/old files
4. Delete all .log files
5. Delete HTML backups

### PHASE 2 (This Week - 4 hours)
1. Create archive/ and scripts/ folders
2. Archive old documentation
3. Move utility scripts to scripts/
4. Unify splash screen implementation
5. Update .gitignore

### PHASE 3 (Next 2 weeks - 6 hours)
1. Consolidate documentation
2. Verify unknown files
3. Update README
4. Create helper scripts

## CRITICAL CONFLICTS TO RESOLVE

1. Splash Screen Implementation
   - launcher.py: uses v3
   - Docs: recommend pro
   - RESOLVE: Choose one version

2. Build Script Selection
   - build_exe_final.py vs desktop/build.py
   - RESOLVE: Verify usage and keep one

3. Documentation Versioning
   - Multiple version files (OLD PRACTICE)
   - RESOLVE: Use git tags instead

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE

DO:
- Use git branches for versions
- Keep single CHANGELOG.md
- Organize utilities in scripts/
- Archive old work immediately
- Update .gitignore

DON'T:
- Create _v1, _v2 file versions
- Leave logs in repository
- Scatter utility scripts
- Create duplicate files
- Mix old and new code
